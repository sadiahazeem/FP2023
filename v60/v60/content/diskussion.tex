All results of the experiment suit the expectations very well. \\
For instance the light beam turns from an LED-beam into the laser beam at a certain current level.
Also the observation of the Rubidium fluorescence and absorption spectrum was clearly as anticipated. 
The background noise of the absorption signal is very low, although here were some difficulties adjusting the 
oscilloscope and the fluorenscence was visible as the beam crosses the Rubidium chamber.
